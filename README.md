## Jesse Sutherland 

I'm a very experienced, indie web developer living in Montreal. Worked with some great people at some very creative and interesting organizations over the years mainly at BlueSponge (RIP) and McGill U.

Heck, for now I'll go with the template:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on awesome one-off web components (vanilla JS or Lit), web component tools, Chrome/FF extensions, Threlte 3d studies (landscapes, vignettes), my blog and other fun stuff
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Astro & Svelte
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on design systems, component-driven design, somehow making the ShadowDom just work ;) 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about CSS, Design Systems, web components or softball, (please no questions about jQuery)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: DM on Bluesky or email
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him - take a hike if this bothers you
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to host a radio show and live in Montreal, which is always a fun fact as it's always a fun city
